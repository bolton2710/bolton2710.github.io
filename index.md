Hello! My name is Bolton.
I am a postdoctoral fellow
working at the [Goldsmith lab](https://cheresearch.engin.umich.edu/goldsmith/)
at the University of Michigan (Go Blue).
I obtained my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering
at Pennsylvania State University (We Are)
working under Dr. [Mike Janik](https://www.che.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=MJJ13)
and Dr. [Scott Milner](https://www.che.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=STM9).

My research involves
developing
state-of-the-art molecular models
to study and understand electrochemistry and catalysis
with broad applications
in sustainable energy storage and chemical synthesis.

I created this site for mainly selfish reasons.
The biggest one is to "market" myself
a little since **I am currently on the faculty job market (2024)** 😝.
I will also post random tutorials
and snippets of my computational research
with pedagogical intent.
I hope create
a random hole-in-the-wall site
that spell-out mathematical and computational methods
geared toward chemistry, physics, and engineering students.
Numerous times have I encountered such hole-in-the-wall sites
that tremendously helped with my research during graduate school,
so this is my way of paying it forward (plus it's fun) 😊.
